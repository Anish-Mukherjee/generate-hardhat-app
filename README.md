# generate-hardhat-app

Getting started with a new Hardhat file generally involves running 3 repetitive commands, not to mention buggy hardhat installations. 

## Installation

``` npm i -g generate-hardhat-app```

This installs the package globally on your system. Now go to your project directory and simply run 

```generate```

and choose your project template and get started! ðŸš€
