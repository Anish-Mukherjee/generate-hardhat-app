# generate-hardhat-app

Get rid of buggy repetitive hardhat installations!
Instead start off your project from these open source templates and reduce your time to GTFOL(look it up, seriously!)

## Installation

``` npm i -g generate-hardhat-app```

This installs the package globally on your system. Now go to your project directory and simply run 

```generate```

and choose your project template. cd into your project folder and run 

```npm i --save-dev```

to install the project specific dependencies and get started shipping your product! ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€
